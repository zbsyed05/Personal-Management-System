# Personal-Management-System
A menu-driven prgram that manages information about students and employees, split into faculty an staff, using inheritance and abstract classes. On the terminal it displays a menu of options: adding, finding/printing, or deleting records, and generating tuition invoices for students. It handles input error and catches exceptions. At the end of the program, a report file is created with the information of every person, sorted by faculty, staff and students.
